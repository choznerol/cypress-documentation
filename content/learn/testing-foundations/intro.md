# Testing Foundations

This path will primarily focus on the theory, thinking and philosophy behind testing. We are not going to go into specific technical details, but rather lay the "foundation" for the subsequent paths that do. This path is all about understanding the testing "mindset" and ways to think about testing.

This path will probably contain the most visuals, animations and videos to really help solidify these concepts.
