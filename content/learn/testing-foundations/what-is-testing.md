# What is testing?

## Testing is a mindset.

It is critical to understand this before we go any further. Testing methodologies, tools, frameworks, etc are irrelevant if you first do not understand that testing is first and foremost, a mindset.

## Manual vs Automated

Testing can be performed in a variety of different ways but the two primary ways are manual testing and automated testing. Manual testing involves someone physically inspecting an application, while automation involves writing code to make a computer perform the testing.

Ideally, you should do both manual and automated testing, as one does not replace the other. While computers are great at performing the same tasks over and over again, it is easy for them to miss things that might be incredibly obvious to a real human being. Computers afterall, are not the intended audience or user for your application, human beings are.

## Who should be responsible for testing?

Everyone.

While most companies and teams have dedicated QA engineers, ultimately, everyone is responsible for ensuring that an application is working as intended.

So then, why do most teams have dedicated QA engineers?

Mindset.

The primary difference between developers and QA Engineers is that developers **build** things, while QA Engineers **break** things. Each think about the application in completely different ways.
