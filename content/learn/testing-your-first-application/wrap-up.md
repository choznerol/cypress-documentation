# Wrap Up

In just a handful of lessons, we have covered a lot of material and learned how to write tests with Cypress. Hopefully, this section has been helpful in not only teaching you the "how," but also the "why." Remember testing is a mindset, and it takes time to learn how to develop that mindset.

In this section, we only wrote a few tests, but we could easily write dozens more. To see an example of all the possible tests that can be written for this simple todo app, take a look at the master branch of the [repo](https://github.com/robertguss/cypress-example-todomvc). Within the `cypress/integration/app_spec.js` file you will find dozens of tests with tons of code comments describing what each test is doing.

Before moving on to the next section, make sure to read through this file thoroughly. Also fire up Cypress and watch all of these tests execute. Click on each test in the left sidebar of the runner to see what it is doing. You will most likely be quite surprised that you can write so many tests for such a simple todo app.

Not only does this repo contain lots of helpful tests and examples, but it also contains best practices that we recommend.
